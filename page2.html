<p>hat can be called the roots of the botanical garden as an institution are traceable to ancient China and many of the countries bordering the Mediterranean. These actually were often centre<br>
the raising of fruit trees, vegetables, and herbs used for food and in making the crude medicines of the time. After the discovery of printing, manuscripts on plants, which had been in existence for centuries, became more widely circulated, and these stimulated further publication of descriptive works called herbals. The herbalists and their herbals, in turn, stimulated the founding of botanical gardens. By the end of the 16th century there were five such gardens in Europe, and by the mid-20th century several hundred.<br>
 The first two were in Italy, at Pisa (1543) and at Padua (1545). </p>


 <h2>Layout and Facilities</h2>
 <p>Botanical gardens and arboretums differ from parks in that they are generally laid out according to the scientific relationships of their plant collections, rather than exclusively for landscape effect or for playing fields or other essentially recreational endeavours. The traditional practice in laying out a botanical garden is, for example, to gather the trees and shrubs together in an arboretum section of the garden. <br>
Oftentimes, though, trees and shrubs are used to enhance landscape effects by interspersing them throughout the garden, in their respective taxonomic groups, with herbaceous collections.</p>
